        <h1>London</h1>
        <img src="https://deviet.vn/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vuong-quoc-anh.jpg">

            London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom,
            with a population of just over 9 million.[9]
            It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea,
            and has been a major settlement for two millennia.[10]
            The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre,
            was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains boundaries close to its medieval ones.
            [note 1][11] Since the 19th century,[12] the name "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core,
            historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[13]
            which largely comprises Greater London,[14] governed by the Greater London Authority.
            [note 2][15] The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has for centuries hosted the national government and parliament.
            As one of the world's major global cities,[16] London exerts a strong influence on its arts,
            entertainment, fashion, commerce and finance, education, health care, media,
            science and technology, tourism, and transport and communications.
            [17][18] Its GDP (â‚¬801.66 billion in 2017) makes it the largest urban economy in Europe,
            [19] and it is one of the major financial centres in the world. As of 2021,
            London had the most millionaires of any city.[20] With Europe's largest concentration of higher education institutions,
            [21] it is home to Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences,
            the London School of Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College London.
            [22] London has the busiest city airport system in the world[23] and the London Underground is the oldest rapid transit system in the world.
            [24] London is one of the most-visited cities in the world and is home to the most 5-star hotels of any city.[25]
